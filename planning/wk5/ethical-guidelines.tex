\Large\textbf{Ground Rules}
\normalsize
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inclusion:} Everyone’s opinion should be heard
    \item \textbf{No slacking:} Everyone has to take part in group activities. No one should have to feel like they are working harder than everyone else or take on the work someone else is supposed to do.
    \item \textbf{Be punctual:} Respect the time of others (unless there is an external problem)
    \item \textbf{Group chat:} Respect other people’s time and attention by keeping the formal WhatsApp group chat purely academic/professional. Use the Instagram chat for everything else. Everyone should have notifications on and check the WhatsApp at least daily.
    \item \textbf{Communication:} If you can’t meet a deadline or make a meeting, just say so. Don’t leave it till the last minute, maybe we can move things around or reallocate work. You only need to give an explanation if you would like (or are a frequent repeat offender)
    \item \textbf{Be open:} We should all strive to be open with each other, whether that be asking for help where we know we are weak or being able to criticise/take criticism from one another.
    \item \textbf{Deadlines:} Do not leave tasks until just before the deadline, leave some time in case something unexpected happens, you get stuck or need help/thoughts from the team.
\end{itemize}
